-- I assume we'll start with an array of goals and how we think various

-- At the exec level, there are key metrics that all of the teams need to focus
-- on. I think there are 5 key metrics (like revenue, growth, engagement, etc).
-- 
-- Do we need to normalize these metrics under a single value? It would be nice.
-- I'm not sure you can get a clean function out of this. One way to start would
-- be to have the metrics as of today vs the metrics that we want to get to over
-- the next several quarters. For that combination of metrics, we might be able
-- to construct some estimate of value to the company.
