Serve HTTP Request
==================

v0.1, May 16, 2013: Initial version

Overview
--------
In any tool that I put together, we _will_ need to have a web interface, even if
it's read-only. There has to be some way for other people to see what's going on
in the tool. Ultimately, the architecture for a productionized tool will have
its own web server components. What I want to figure out in this prototype is
how to handle a basic GET request and serve a page.

Risk
----
The risk here is that I'm not sure how all of the HTTP protocol steps work. I
want to figure out how to establish a TCP connection with a client and start
sending data over it. We'll start with a simple echo and then move up to a point
where we can connect with curl and then a browser.

Protos
------
. Echo data to telnet
. Display an HTTP request from curl
. Parse HTTP request into headers and a body
. Respond with headers and an empty body
. Respond with a page
