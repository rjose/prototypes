Using ncurses
=============
Rino Jose <@rjose>
v1, June 22, 2013: Initial version

Overview
--------
I'd like to do less scrolling and have more control over how text is rendered.
Some of this is putting text into a particular part of the screen. Some of it is
creating tables consistently. Some of this is highlighting text properly.

Risk
----
Not sure if we'll need to do everything from C. Not sure how lua fits into this.
Should lua be at the top or should it be underneath? I started by wanting lua at
the top level and then writing C modules for it to call. However, I'm beginning
to think it should just be a part of the apps that we write.

Prototypes
----------
. Go through ncurses tutorial [][][][][][][]

. Embed lua in the app and have an entry area and an output [][][][][][]

. Format a table with ncurses [][][][][]

. Integrate a mocked out qplan into ncurses [][][][][][]
