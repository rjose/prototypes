Overview
--------
We need some functions for doing base64 encoding and decoding.

Prototypes
----------
. Use openssl [][][]


Proto1: Use openssl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm going to basically port the functions that from
link:http://doctrina.org/Base64-With-OpenSSL-C-API.html[here]. I'll do a
little renaming. I'll test this by comparing against running openssl from the
commandline. For example:

----
$ echo "Hello" | openssl base64
SGVsbG8K
----

Here's how to decode:

----
$ echo "SGVsbG8K" | openssl base64 -d
Hello
----
