AssocArray
==========

v1, Jun 24, 2013: Initial version

Overview
--------
This is a data structure that we'll need as part of QPlan (and probably any
other app I write in C). I want to be able to init an AssocArray and set values
on it. I want to be able to get the keys in some order. We should be able to
specify a compare function for each AssocArray.

It would be useful to have AssocArrays that had arrays of doubles as values.

We need to map a function that takes something like work items and returns
AssocArrays.


Risks
-----
Not sure how to be careful about memory management. Not sure how to store arrays
as AssocArray values. Should we have a specific Array type? Maybe.

Prototypes
----------
. Initialize an AssocArray [X][][]
. Set and get values [][][][]
. Reduce a list of AssocArrays [][][][]
. Reduce a list of AssocArrays with Array values [][][][]
. Map a function over something that returns an AssocArray [][][][]


Proto1: Initialize an AssocArray
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's start by initializing an AssocArray. That should help flesh out what the
structs should look like. I'll model some of this after the
link:http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Algorithms-with-C-ebook/dp/B0043EWV5Q[Algos
in C] book. Hmmm...there wasn't much to this part. Oh well. Let's set and get
some values next.

Proto2: Set and get values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What we'll need to do here is initialize an AssocArray and then set some values
on it. If we can get them back, then great. We should also write the function
that returns a sorted list of keys.
