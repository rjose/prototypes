Drafting effort: [][]

Overview

I want to understand the options for doing web layout. I want to explore
floating layouts and grid layouts. I want to understand positioning and
setting up navigation elements.

Proto1: Create floating two column layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will basically follow what's laid out in the CSS Anthology book. I'll add
outlines so I can see the blocks. I'll have a section for the track selector
and one for the main content. From the w3.org site on
link:http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML_structural_elements#.3Csection.3E[structural
tags], they say that one valid use for divs is for grouping areas of content
for styling.

Alright, I got something working where I positioned the sections. Let's check
this in. OK, let's add a topline navigation. I guess I can position this, too.
OK, I added topline navigation.

Let's add some bogus content and verify that the sticky menu works. Looks
good. Let's check in.

Proto2: Add triage control and overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There's a range control that I want to use. It would be nice if I could add
labels for each triage level, too. Adding labels looks like some work.
Instead, I'll just show the value after the triage slider.

OK, next is adding a summary table that shows total demand by skill, total
available and net. Let's style the table next. Done.

Before we go, let's style what happens when net left is less than or equal to
zero.


Proto3: Add work details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Next up is adding the work details. Let's just show rank, track, item, and
estimates. We'll also show the cutline and the feasible range. Let's get some
phony data in place and start styling.
