Drafting effort: [][]

Overview
--------
I want to understand the options for doing web layout. I want to explore
floating layouts and grid layouts. I want to understand positioning and
setting up navigation elements.

Prototypes
----------
. Create positioned two column layout [][][]
. Create grid-based two column layout [][][][]
. Add top navigation [][][][]


Proto1: Create floating two column layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will basically follow what's laid out in the CSS Anthology book. I'll add
outlines so I can see the blocks. I'll have a section for the track selector
and one for the main content. From the w3.org site on
link:http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML_structural_elements#.3Csection.3E[structural
tags], they say that one valid use for divs is for grouping areas of content
for styling.

Alright, I got something working where I positioned the sections. Let's check
this in. OK, let's add a topline navigation. I guess I can position this, too.
OK, I added topline navigation.
