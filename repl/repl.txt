REPL with status
================

v0.1, May 13, 2013: Initial version

Overview
--------
We want to set up some threads in this app. One thread should be the main
thread. This should wait for all the other threads. Another thread should be the
repl. This should look and service requests. We should handle keyboard
interrupts. C-c should cancel out of whatever command is executiong. C-d should
exit the entire app.

We should be able to simulate http and web socket requests. We should have a
command that queries the number of threads and gets info on the number of active
connections. We'll just mock this out here. Another prototype will explore that.

Risk
----
The risk we're looking at here is making sure I know how to use pthreads
properly. I guess I'll study an example from the pthreads book and make sure I
know what I'm doing.

To explore some testability, it would be nice if we could script the behavior of
the app. This might be a follow-on prototype.

Steps
-----
. From the main thread, create a REPL thread and join to it
. Allocate some thread structures to point to active threads. Keep these in
  sync.
. Add some repl commands for simulating a request.
. Add a repl command for reporting on the app status
. Handle keyboard interrupts
