Lua Shell
=========

v1, Jun 12, 2013: Initial version

Overview
--------
I've been running into issues with lua and pthreads. I think it has something to
do with how the lua interpreter was built. I'm going to build my own shell that
sets up things for Objective-C. I'll also make sure it works with the lua repl.

Prototypes
----------
. Start a thread
. Add a simple lua repl
. Create a thread from lua
