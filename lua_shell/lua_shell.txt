Lua Shell
=========

v1, Jun 12, 2013: Initial version

Overview
--------
I've been running into issues with lua and pthreads. I think it has something to
do with how the lua interpreter was built. I'm going to build my own shell that
sets up things for Objective-C. I'll also make sure it works with the lua repl.

Prototypes
----------
. Start a thread
. Add a simple lua repl
. Create a thread from lua
. Listen for connections in a thread
. Incorporate readline into shell (ABANDONED)
. Incorporate readline into shell 2 [][][]

Proto1: Start a thread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just something to get started.


Proto2: Add a simple lua repl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'll work through the example in the lua manual. The first thing I want to do is
make sure I can build and link against the lua library.


Proto3: Create a thread from lua
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We'll just create a simple thread. This is what we were hung up on last time. Do
we get anything by moving this into its own module? I guess we'd get
architectural separation. Maybe we'll do this next.


Proto4: Listen for connections in a thread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's go long on this one and respond to an http request. First, we'll listen
for and then close connections. Next, we'll copy the handle http function over.
Done! Well, it's nice to have gotten this working. Hopefully, it will still work
on the Linux side...Ugh no. A couple of things. One was that I needed to hack
up the makefile for building lua to add shared library support (added -fpic to
compile, and -shared, -Wl,-soname,liblua.so.5 for linking). I followed along
link:http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html[here].
Next problem was that GNUStep didn't seem to work properly. I think I may
abandon it for now and circle back if it makes sense. It's probably too heavy
anyways.


Proto5: Incorporate readline (ABANDONED)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If this is easy, we'll do it. If not, this should go into its own prototype.
OK, I abandoned this one, too, but I think I know what's going on now (name
collision over readline -- it's in tcp_io and in readline (obviously).

Proto6: Incorporate readline into shell 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alright, let's try this again. This time, we'll go straight C. I'll start by
building the readline portion.
