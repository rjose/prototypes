Lua Shell
=========

v1, Jun 12, 2013: Initial version

Overview
--------
I've been running into issues with lua and pthreads. I think it has something to
do with how the lua interpreter was built. I'm going to build my own shell that
sets up things for Objective-C. I'll also make sure it works with the lua repl.

Prototypes
----------
. Start a thread
. Add a simple lua repl
. Create a thread from lua
. Listen for connections in a thread
. Incorporate readline into shell

Proto1: Start a thread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just something to get started


Proto2: Add a simple lua repl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'll work through the example in the lua manual. The first thing I want to do is
make sure I can build and link against the lua library.

Proto3: Create a thread from lua
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We'll just create a simple thread. This is what we were hung up on last time. Do
we get anything by moving this into its own module? I guess we'd get
architectural separation. Maybe we'll do this next.

Proto4: Listen for connections in a thread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's go long on this one and respond to an http request. First, we'll listen
for and then close connections. Next, we'll copy the handle http function over.
Done! Well, it's nice to have gotten this working. Hopefully, it will still work
on the Linux side...
