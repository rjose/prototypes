Lua Server
==========
Rino Jose <rjose@linkedin.com>
v1, Jun 11, 2013: Initial version

Drafting effort: [][]

Overview
--------
The link:https://github.com/rjose/products/tree/b83bd0/qplan/v1[
commandline shell version of QPlan] is good enough to start using for planning.
I think the terminal version would work fine as well. However, people do expect
a web UI, and so this prototype explores the options for doing that. Right now,
it will be read-only, but if it makes sense, we might add some ability to post
as well.

Risks
-----
I don't know how to accept a web connection request from lua yet. Not sure if
everything is synchronous? My original plan was to do all of this from C, but if
I can get this working from Lua, that would make things go faster.

I also want to get websockets running so everything can be driven from the
commandline shell. Not sure if there's a lua websockets library that can do this
for me. If not, I'll have to drop down to C and add another week to this.

Prototypes

. Listen for a connection [][][][][]
. Establish a connection and echo a response [][][][]
. Accept an HTTP request [][][][][]
. Respond with an HTTP page [][][]
. Send a websocket message [][][][][][][][]

Proto1: Echo data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's start by using the lua socket library and see what it can do. I guess the
first thing we should do is get a demo of it working. We'll have to install it.
Here's the link:http://luaforge.net/projects/luasocket/[download page] for it.
Wow, this hasn't been updated since 2007. Hopefully it works...Nope. Looks like
there's a link:https://github.com/diegonehab/luasocket/[github project] for
this. Let's see if this works. Alright, it seems to have built. Let's look at
the demo code.

The demo client didn't seem to work. Let's take the sample server code and see
if we can get it to echo something. Hmmm. This seems a little hard to follow. I
wonder if I can just port the C version from the
link:https://github.com/rjose/prototypes/tree/master/repl[repl prototype] and
hook it up to lua? Let's abandon proto1 and try this next.
